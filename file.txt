ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript language standard. Introduced in 2015, ES6 brought many new features and improvements aimed at making JavaScript code more concise, readable, and maintainable. One of the most notable additions is the introduction of let and const keywords, providing block-scoped variables, which helped mitigate issues with variable hoisting. Additionally, ES6 introduced arrow functions, making function declarations more concise and providing lexical scoping of the this keyword. Template literals allow for more expressive string interpolation, while destructuring assignment simplifies the process of extracting values from arrays and objects. With the spread and rest operators, manipulating arrays and objects became more intuitive and flexible. Classes were introduced as syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, offering a more familiar syntax for defining objects and their behaviors. Overall, ECMAScript 6 marked a significant step forward for JavaScript, empowering developers with new tools and syntax to write cleaner, more efficient code.
